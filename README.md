So this is a site which will mail you random quotes on providing your email as an input. Part of a web mashing experiment including rapid apii's random quotes api and a SMTP mail server using Nodemailer API (made by me :))

For trying out,
in the server directory, create a *.env* file with vars as follows:
EMAIL=_ur__port__here
PASS=__Ur_Pass_here__
